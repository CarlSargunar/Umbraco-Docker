# Umbraco and docker - Part 1 : Getting familiar with containers

Docker is not a new technology, it‚Äôs been around since its initial release in March, 2013 and in that time it‚Äôs had an absolutely phenomenal impact on the makeup of web applications and services and transforming the way applications are deployed. 

It hasn‚Äôt had quite the same impact in our world of content managed websites, and I think we‚Äôre missing out on some great opportunities to make the sites we build faster, more efficient, more scalable and more resilient. In this blog I‚Äôll guide you through the steps to do the following

- Install and configure Docker on your machine
- Defining your application in containers
- Splitting your application into multiple containers
- Using Docker compose to define your application

## Prerequisites

In order to run this application you will need the following installed on your machine.

- Visual Studio Code
    - There's a useful docker extension for Visual studio code : [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview)
- Docker Desktop 
    - Windows subsystem for Linux (only required in Windows obviously)	
- .NET SDK version 5
    - This will also work with .NET version 6, but you need the SDK

## Structure for this walkthrough

This is broken into 2 main parts, the first part of which is this article, broken down as follows

### Part 1 : Building and running an Umbraco website in a container

1. Start from a basic website
2. Create a Docker Database container
3. Create the application container and make them talk to each other

# Installing Docker

If you‚Äôre on Windows or Mac the best option is Docker desktop - this is a free (for individuals) application provided by docker which simply sets everything up for you. Docker on Linux is a little more involved. I won‚Äôt go through specific steps for any of the platforms here, but there are pretty good details on how to do that here : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/


Once Docker is running, you‚Äôll be able to issue commands on the command line or using the Docker Desktop tool on Mac and Windows. Whichever tool you use, the output is the same, and the effect is the same. That‚Äôs kinda the whole point of Docker üôÇ

Docker does have different system requirements depending on if you want to run just Windows containers or Linux containers, or both. Full details of these requirements can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/ 

For most of my examples, and indeed most production workloads typically run on Linux containers - these are far more common than Windows containers, especially if you are relying on the latest software. Windows containers are typically only used where a Linux container is not available, or for example with applications built on the .NET framework 4.8 which only runs on Windows. 

# Key Docker Concepts

Now Docker is installed there are few things you need to know before you start creating containers and applications.

## What is Docker? 

Without going into too much detail, Docker is similar but also fundamentally different to the technology used to create and host virtual machines. 

Traditional virtualization will virtualize the hardware, allowing you to host any secondary operating systems, but you are responsible for the entire operating system, the configuration, and the deployment of your application.

Docker virtualizes the operating system, so each container doesn‚Äôt need its own operating system, it merely uses the host operating system. Thus with a virtual machine you have a lot more control, but with Docker you have much better resource management, as you‚Äôre not duplicating the whole operating system, thus the exact same hardware can run a few virtual machines, but probably many more Docker containers.

## Docker Image
The image is a blueprint for the container instance in an analogous way that a class definition is the blueprint to each instance of that class. The individual properties can be different - Name, Id, or any property, and that same class can be used to make 1, 2, 100 classes.

Typically when you build your image for your application, you will build it on a base image which is typically the smallest number of additional features to keep your container size small. 

## Container Registry
The registry is either an internal or publicly accessible repository of container images, much like Nuget is a repository of packages. These images can be downloaded to the docker host as an instance of a running container. This is where common applications like SQLServer, Redis, Node which are in turn built on base images - like ubuntu or alpine. 

The public repository from DockerHub can be found at https://hub.docker.com/.

## Dockerfile

The definition file for your application, which describes the base image which is used, plus any steps required to compile and deploy the application, any configuration. It typically lives in the root of your application and gets put into source control alongside your application.

# Part 1 : Building an Umbraco container application

Let‚Äôs start with a blank slate and create a new umbraco application running standalone on our local machine. This will be an Umbraco 9 site built on the .NET 5, but the samples will also work with .NET 6.

**NOTE :** These instructions are intended for Windows developers, if you are using a Mac or Linux as your main development tool, there are a few different steps you need to follow, as LocalDB isn‚Äôt supported. I‚Äôll highlight these at the end of the article

First ensure the Umbraco templates are installed

[INSTRUCTIONS]


At this point the project is a normal Umbraco site running locally on your development machine. It works with source control, can be published to a web server, everything you would normally be able to do. 



# Part 2 : Running a database from a container

Now that the application is running locally there‚Äôs still a problem. The database we have is SQL Server Express LocalDB - and as such doesn‚Äôt run on Linux or Mac. If you try to run it you‚Äôll see the error ‚ÄúLocalDB is not supported on this platform.‚Äù

To get around that we need a database server, and since we already have Docker, we can just run one in there and access it from our website container. To create this do the following in the cloned repository

1. Copy the folder Files/UmbData folder from the files directory to the root. 
2. Into the same folder you will need to copy the database files from UmbDock/umbraco/Data

That folder contains a Dockerfile which defines the Database server we will create, as well as some additional steps to restore the database from our earlier step



The first line defines the image we will be using: SQL Server 2019 running on Ubuntu. After that we define our password for the SA account, which is the main SQL Admin account. 

The key thing this file does after this is all done is launch Startup.sh, which is listed below. The main job of startup.sh is to sleep for 15 seconds while the sql server is starting up, and run setup.sql under the server admin (or sa) account. Note the password is also defined here.



The setup.sql script will re-attach the database to the sql server once it‚Äôs running.

At this point if you go back to your umbraco project and edit your connectionstring to connect to this. Amend the appsettings.Development.json as follows:

    "umbracoDbDSN": "Server=localhost,1400;Database=UmbracoDb;User Id=sa;Password=SQL_password123;"


Note : We‚Äôre using port 1400 rather than the normal 1433, since it‚Äôs possible you already have SQL server running locally, and if we used the same port it would conflict.

With that done, we can build the Docker database image

And when that‚Äôs complete, run the docker SQL server - note again the port being used - internally the Docker image still uses 1433, but externally it uses 1400 so as not to conflict with any other local SQL servers


# Part 3 : Running the application in Docker

To run the project in Docker, we need to create a new file in the root of our web project called Dockerfile. 

    # Use the SDK image to build and publish the website
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
    WORKDIR /src
    COPY ["UmbDock.csproj", "."]
    RUN dotnet restore "UmbDock.csproj"
    COPY . .
    RUN dotnet publish "UmbDock.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
    
    # Copy the published output to the final running image
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS final
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=build /app/publish .
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "UmbDock.dll"]
 

Let‚Äôs break this file down. The first line describes the base container which will be used to build the application, and thus it needs the .NET 5 SDK container image, as that image has the build tools included in it.

The 2nd line sets the working directory inside the image, and the following line copies the project file into the container. 

The 4th line runs a dotnet restore to import any nuget packages referenced by the project. 

The 5th line copes all files across, and the 6th line builds the project and sets the output to /app/publish

The next section defines the image used to RUN the application, which sets the working directory, copies the output from the published application from the previous section and sets the starting code for the container image. 

# Docker Networks

Before we can run the website in a container we need to know a little about Docker networking. There are many modes of networking in Docker which allow containers to communicate. The main type is Bridge networks and there are default bridge networks and user-defined bridge networks. 

The default bridge network is just the network that all containers are automatically added to if none is specified, and any container can communicate with any other container - however it can only do so using IP addresses, which are dynamically assigned

In a user-defined bridge network you can communicate using the network name, but only containers which are explicitly added to the network can communicate with each other using the container name. 

First we will create the container.

  docker network create -d bridge umbNet

We‚Äôre then going to connect our database container to that network. Note our container name (umbdata) is how we add it.

    docker network connect umbNet umbdata

# Building the application container image
Now that we‚Äôve got a database container running and connected to our user-defined network, we can build our application image.

    docker build --tag=umbdock .\UmbDock
 
Once the image is build we can run the image.

    docker run --name umbdock00 -p 8000:80 -v media:/app/wwwroot/media -v logs:/app/umbraco/Logs -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT='Staging' --network=umbNet -d umbdock


If all goes well, you‚Äôll be able to access the site on any browser at http://localhost:8000/
